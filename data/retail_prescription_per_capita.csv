Sales data reflects an estimate based on retail product dispensing only and does not reflect sales of pharmaceutical products into pharmacy outlets. Retail pharmacies include independent pharmacies, chain pharmacies, food stores, and mass merchandisers. Total prescription volumes represent the projected volume filled at retail pharmacies only and a small portion of over-the-counter medications and repackagers."
